## thoughts from now

### build a house?
- recording studio: monitor & live room. everything right where you need it. so cozy.
- > live room backwall opens up to a secluded deck for totally altered acoustics & air.
- climbing wall: handmade holds (luminous) & volumes & even the wall / tilt mechanism.
- fab studio: cnc for wood. large-scale 3d print. bike build shop. basement / garage?
- > maybe welding one day? i want to be able to build whatever comes to mind.
- textiles room: sewing & knitting machines. lots of vertical storage.
- greenhouse: in central courtyard? or on the side like at a nursery.
